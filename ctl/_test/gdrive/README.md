# DrEdit

DrEdit is a sample Google Drive app, is a text editor that is capable of editing files with `text/*` MIME type that are stored in user's Google Drive. It has similar implementations for Java, Python, PHP, .NET, Ruby, Android and iOS. DrEdit also implements two fundamental Google Drive use cases:

* [Create a new file from the Google Drive UI](https://developers.google.com/drive/integrate-create#create_a_new_file_from_the_drive_ui)
* [Open a file from the Google Drive UI](https://developers.google.com/drive/integrate-open#open_files_using_the_open_with_contextual_menu)

The flow for both use cases is similar. Google Drive redirects a user to the
app after the user selects it from the **Create** menu or context menu of a
file with a registered MIME type.
